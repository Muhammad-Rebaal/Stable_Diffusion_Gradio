# Stable Diffusion App using Gradio and Diffusers 2.0

## Overview
This project aims to create a stable diffusion app utilizing Gradio and Diffusers 2.0 by Hugging Face. The app will allow users to apply diffusion models to their text inputs, generating coherent and diverse outputs. Gradio provides an intuitive interface for users to interact with the diffusion models seamlessly.

## Features
1. **Text Input**: Users can input text they want to apply the diffusion model to.
2. **Model Selection**: Users can choose from a variety of diffusion models provided by Diffusers 2.0.
3. **Parameter Tuning**: Users can adjust parameters specific to the chosen diffusion model to customize the output.
4. **Real-time Output**: The app displays the generated text output in real-time as users make changes.

## Technologies Used
- **Gradio**: A Python library that enables rapid creation of UIs for machine learning models.
- **Diffusers 2.0**: A library by Hugging Face that provides access to pre-trained diffusion models.
